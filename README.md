# Slide projector

The goal of this project is to emulate my father's old slide projector, so he can view his digital images the same
way he can view analog slides.

This project is heavily inspired by the Photoframe sample in the [Google Photos Library API Samples project](https://github.com/googlesamples/google-photos)
